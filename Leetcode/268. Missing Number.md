## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/)
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,0,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

`n = 3` since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,3]`. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

`n = 2` since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,2]`. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

`n = 9` since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,9]`. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.



## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

This one is pretty straightforward. If we XOR a number twice, we receive 0. If we XOR a number once, we receive that number. So if we XOR every number, and then XOR every number in our array, we should see the missing number. We want to initialize our result to the length of the array to account for the missing number being the last number.

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = len(nums)
        comp = 0

        for num in range(0, len(nums)):
            ans ^= num
        for num in nums:
            ans ^= num

        return ans
```
