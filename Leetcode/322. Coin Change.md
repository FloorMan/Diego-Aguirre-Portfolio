## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/)

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`

## My Approach
### Time: $O(n * k)$

The trick with this one is to turn it into a bottom-up DP approach. Start at 0 coins used, and store the least amount of coins used in the index. At every index, use the value of the coins to determine how far back to look for hte least amount of coins used.

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if len(coins) == 1:
            return int(amount / coins[0]) if amount % coins[0] == 0 else -1
        

        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for ptr in range(1, amount + 1):
            for coin in coins:
                if ptr - coin >= 0:
                    dp[ptr] = min(dp[ptr], 1 + dp[ptr - coin])
        
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] <= amount else -1
```
