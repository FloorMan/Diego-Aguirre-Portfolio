## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/)
Given a reference of a node in aÂ **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_\(graph_theory\)#Connected_graph)**Â undirected graph.

Return aÂ [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)Â (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

``` Java
class Node {
     public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```
**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node withÂ `val == 1`, the second node withÂ `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list**Â is a collection of unorderedÂ **lists**Â used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node withÂ `val = 1`. You must return theÂ **copy of the given node**Â as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

**Input:** adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

**Input:** adjList = [[]]
**Output:** [[]]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = []
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the rangeÂ `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val`Â is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.


## My Approach
### Time: 
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
Â  Â  def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
Â  Â  Â  Â  self.val = val
Â  Â  Â   self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""
  
from typing import Optional
class Solution:
Â  Â  def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
Â  Â  Â  Â  if not node: return node
  
Â  Â  Â  Â  q = deque([node])
Â  Â  Â  Â  clones = {node.val: Node(node.val, [])}
  
Â  Â  Â  Â  while q:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  curr = q.popleft()
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  curr_clone = clones[curr.val]
  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  for nodes in curr.neighbors:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  if nodes.val not in clones:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  clones[nodes.val] = Node(nodes.val, [])
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  q.append(nodes)
  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  curr_clone.neighbors.append(clones[nodes.val])

  
Â  Â  Â  Â  return clones[node.val]
```
We use a hashmap to reference the cloned nodes by their value. Then we enque the cloned nodes and check the neighbors. If the val isnâ€™t in the hashmap, we add it. Then we add the cloned node to the neighbors adjacency list of our cloned node.

## [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/solutions/1792858/python3-iterative-bfs-beats-98-explained)
**UPVOTE if you like (ðŸŒ¸â— â€¿â— ), If you have any question, feel free to ask.**

To solve this problem we need two things:

1. BFS to traverse the graph
2. A hash map to keep track of already visited and already cloned nodes

We push a node in the queue and make sure that the node is already cloned. Then we process neighbors. If a neighbor is already cloned and visited, we just append it to the current clone neighbors list, otherwise, we clone it first and append it to the queue to make sure that we can visit it in the next tick.

Time:Â **O(V + E)**Â - for BFS  
Space:Â **O(V)**Â - for the hashmap

Runtime: 32 ms, faster thanÂ **98.18%**Â of Python3 online submissions for Clone Graph.  
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less thanÂ **91.72%**Â of Python3 online submissions for Clone Graph.

```kotlin
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node: return node
        
        q, clones = deque([node]), {node.val: Node(node.val, [])}
        while q:
            cur = q.popleft() 
            cur_clone = clones[cur.val]            

            for ngbr in cur.neighbors:
                if ngbr.val not in clones:
                    clones[ngbr.val] = Node(ngbr.val, [])
                    q.append(ngbr)
                    
                cur_clone.neighbors.append(clones[ngbr.val])
                
        return clones[node.val]
```
