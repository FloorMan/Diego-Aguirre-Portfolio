## Problem
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/submissions/1557660954/)
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

## Thoughts


## My Approach
### Time: O(n)

My first thought was to go at it with a two pointer approach (one on the left, one on the right). As we move towards the middle, we keep track of the smallest and the largest values on both sides, creating a max profit.
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # We go for a two pointer approach here. 
        # Go towards center, update smallest pointer on left largest pointer on right
        # If left >= right, twas not meant to be (0)
        smallestLeft = prices[0]
        biggestRight = prices[-1]

        leftPtr = 0
        rightPtr = len(prices) - 1

        while leftPtr <= rightPtr:
            smallestLeft = min(smallestLeft, prices[leftPtr])
            biggestRight = max(biggestRight, prices[rightPtr])
            leftPtr +=1
            rightPtr -= 1

        return max(biggestRight - smallestLeft, 0)
```
The issue with this approach is that it fails to account for max profits that fall outside of the center. A better approach would be to use #Kadanesalgorithm:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Use Kadane's algorithm. Find the max sum of a subarray in O(n)
        buy = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        for index in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[index] < buy:
                buy = prices[index]
            profit = max(profit, prices[index] - buy)
        return profit
```
Here, we keep track of the smallest value so far and the greatest profit so far. If we come across a smaller value, we reset our smallest value (buy) and update our profit accordingly.
