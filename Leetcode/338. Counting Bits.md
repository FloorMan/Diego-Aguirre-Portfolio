## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/description/)
Given an integer `n`, return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `n + 1` _such that for each_ `i` (`0 <= i <= n`)_,_ `ans[i]` _is the **number of**_ `1`_**'s** in the binary representation of_ `i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** [0,1,1]
**Explanation:**
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** [0,1,1,2,1,2]
**Explanation:**
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 105`

**Follow up:**

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

The $O(n \log{n})$ solution was trivial, so I decided to implement the $O(n)$ solution instead. We check to see if the corresponding bit in the counter is set for our index; If it is, we know there is only 1 bit set for that index. If not, we know that the amount of bits in our index is equal to the amount of bits set in a previous index, except with the leading bit turned on (plus one). We jump back to the previous index containing our subproblem.

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        
        ans = [0] * (n + 1)
        counter = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i ^ counter == 0):
                ans[i] = 1
                counter = counter << 1
            else:
	            # We divide the counter by 2 to know how many spaces to jump back 
                ans[i] = ans[i - (counter >> 1) ] + 1
        return ans
```
