## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/)

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## My Approach
### Time: $O(n \cdot m)$

I understood how to do it, but itâ€™s been a while since I implemented it, so I was having some trouble remembering and working through which cell I should copy from. And then I had trouble because I forgot to copy two arrays.

Essentially, we want to keep track of the longest common subsequence at any given index, so we iterate through each character in the second word, match it to the first word, and if it matches, we increase our longest subsequence. If not, we take the max subsequence so far.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        
        dp1 = [0] * (len(text1) + 1)
        dp2 = [0] * (len(text1) + 1)

        for char2 in text2:
            for index in range(1,  len(text1) + 1):
                if char2 == text1[index - 1]:
                    dp2[index] = dp1[index - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp2[index] = max(dp2[index - 1], dp2[index])

            dp1 = dp2.copy()

        return dp2[-1]
```
