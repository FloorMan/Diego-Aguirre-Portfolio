## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)
Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,1]

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

Very easy. Same principle as [[268. Missing Number]]. If we XOR a number twice, we get 0. If we XOR a number once, we get that number.

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for num in nums:
            ans ^= num
        return ans
```
