## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

This one is simple enough, we just keep track of the maximum amount of jumps we have at any given moment. If we get to zero jumps left, and the space we land on has a max jump of 0, we know that making it to the end will be impossible.

We also have to account for the edge case where the nums array has a length of 1, so even if the max jump is 0, we still make it to the end.

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return True

        jumpsLeft = nums[0]

        for num in nums[:len(nums) - 1]:
            if jumpsLeft <= 0 and num == 0:
                return False
            
            jumpsLeft = max(jumpsLeft, num)
            jumpsLeft -= 1

        return True
```
