[[LeetCode]]

## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/)
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

**Note** that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 105`
- `intervals` is sorted by `starti` in **ascending** order.
- `newInterval.length == 2`
- `0 <= start <= end <= 105`


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$


We solve this one by splitting up our interval insertion into three parts: Before the overlap, during the overlap, and after the overlap.

Before the overlap, we want to add the intervals to our answer. We know this is before the overlap because the new interval start is after the interval end.

During the overlap, we dont want to add any intervals to our answer. Instead, we modify our new interval to include the start and end times of the overlapping interval.

Once we finish the overlap, we add the new interval to the result.

Finally, we add the rest of the intervals to our answer.


```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(intervals) == 0:
            return [newInterval]
        if newInterval[0] > intervals[-1][1]:
            intervals.append(newInterval)
            return intervals        
        
        answer = []
        def overlap(a, b):
            return a[0] <= b[1] and a[1] >= b[0]

        # Before overlap
        i = 0
        while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]:
            answer.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1
        
        while i < len(intervals) and newInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]:
            newInterval = [min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]), max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1])]
            i += 1

        answer.append(newInterval)

        while i < len(intervals):
            answer.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1

        return answer
```
