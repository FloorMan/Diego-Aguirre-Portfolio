[[LeetCode]]

## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)
Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
**Output:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
**Explanation:** Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
**Output:** [[1,5]]
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
**Output:** [[1,7]]
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n \log n)$

Here we sort the intervals by their starting time, and then add a new interval only if the current interval start after the last interval end.
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        merged = []

        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
        return merged
```
