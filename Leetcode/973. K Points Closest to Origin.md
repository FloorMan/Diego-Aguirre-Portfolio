## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/)



## My Approach
### Time: 


```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = []

        for point in points:
            x,y = point
            dist = x * x + y * y

            heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))
        ans = []

        for i in range(k):
            _, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            ans.append([x, y])

        return ans
```
