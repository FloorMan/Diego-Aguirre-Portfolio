## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

There is only two ways to get to the step, which is the previous step - 1 and the previous step - 2. This means that if we add up the unique ways to get to those steps, we have the total amount for our step
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2


        steps = [0] * n
        steps[0] = 1
        steps[1] = 2

        for i in range(2, n):
            steps[i] = steps[i - 1] + steps[i - 2] 

        return steps[-1]
```
