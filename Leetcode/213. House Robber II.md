## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/description/)
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,2]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

Here, we just run the orignal house robber algorithm on the array excluding the first value, and the last value. We want to find which will yield the highest result. We also have to include the edge case of there only being one value.
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def maxRob(nums):
            rob1, rob2 = 0, 0

            for num in nums:
                maxMoney = max(rob1 + num, rob2)
                rob1 = rob2
                rob2 = maxMoney

            return rob2

        return max(maxRob(nums[1:]), maxRob(nums[:-1]), nums[0])
```
