# Leetcode Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems.  
Each solution is documented in Markdown with the problem description, approach, and lessons learned.  
My goal is to continually improve problem-solving, optimize algorithms, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Easy
- [Two Sum](Leetcode/TwoSum.md)
- [Valid Parentheses](Leetcode/ValidParentheses.md)

## Medium
- [Add Two Numbers](Leetcode/AddTwoNumbers.md)
- [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](Leetcode/LongestSubstring.md)

## Hard
