## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.


## My Approach
### Time: $O(V + E)$

This approach uses Kahnâ€™s Algorithm, which checks if there are any cycles in our graph. We constantly check the amount of incoming edges to our node. If our node has no incoming edges, we check that one first in our queue. We create an adjacency array for each node.

We go through our queue, adding nodes with no incoming degrees. Once we pop the node from the queue, we check the outgoing edges, and remove those as incoming edges from other nodes. We repeat this until we add the first node with a cycle, at which point our answer array will be larger than the amount of courses, and we know we have a cycle.


```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = numCourses
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        indegree = [0] * n
        ans = []

        for pair in prerequisites:
            course, prerequisite = pair[0], pair[1]
            adj[prerequisite].append(course)
            indegree[course] += 1

        queue = deque()
        for i in range(n):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)

        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            ans.append(current)

            for next_course in adj[current]:
                indegree[next_course] -= 1
                if indegree[next_course] == 0:
                    queue.append(next_course)

        return len(ans) == n
```
