## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/)
Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation:
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:
Input: n = 128
Output: 1
Explanation:
The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:
Input: n = 2147483645
Output: 30
Explanation:
The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 231 - 1

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

Pretty simple problem, the approach is to just keep shifting n to the right and checking if the ones place is set. If it is, we increment our counter.

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:        
        count = 0
        while n:
            if n & 1 == 1:
                count += 1
            n = n >> 1

        return count
```
