## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/description/)
Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return _the number of possible combinations that add up to_Â `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:**
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [9], target = 3
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `nums` are **unique**.
- `1 <= target <= 1000`

**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?


## My Approach
### Time: 

The trick here is to create a dynamic programming array to hold the unique number of ways to get to each sum. We add up the current number of ways to get to that index to the new index of the sum we found:
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(target + 1):
            for num in nums:
                if num + i <= target:
                    dp[num + i] +=dp[i]

        return dp[-1]  
```

If we were to add negative numbers, the only change to our algorithm would be to check if the number is greater than or equal to 0. In terms of the question, we would have to specify that the negative numbers are not equal to any positive integers, as this would cause an infinite loop.
