## Thoughts


## My Approach
### Time: O(n * k)
We will store the letter frequencies as a key-value pair in a hash map. The letter frequency is the key, and the values are going to be a list of indexes that share that frequency. 
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        frequencies = {}
  
        for word in strs:
            letters = [0] * 52
            for char in word:
                letters[(ord(char) - ord('a'))*2] += 1
            letters = "".join(map(str, letters))
            if letters not in frequencies:
                frequencies[letters] = [word]
            else:
                frequencies[letters].append(word)
        return list(frequencies.values())     
```
Here we go through each word, count the frequency of each letter, and then use that as the key for our dictionary. Then, we return the values of each key. 
There is an edge case to look out for with `["bdddddddddd","bbbbbbbbbbc"]` since when adding up the frequencies, the number will look the same when converted to a string.
