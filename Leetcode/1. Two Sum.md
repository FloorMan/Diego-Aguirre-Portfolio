## Problem
[Link to Question]()
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

## Thoughts


## My Approach
### Time: O(1)

The naive implementation would be to simply iterate through every number to find the first solution, but this is O(n^2). I’ll challenge myself to find a <n^2 solution.

First thought would be to add a list. If the current number’s reverse is not in the list, I add it with it’s corresponding number to reach the target. 

If not in the dictionary, we add it to the dictionary with it’s index. If we find the needed integer to complete the target in the dictionary, then we return.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        targetSum = {}
        for index in range(len(nums)):
            x = target - nums[index]
            if x not in targetSum:
                targetSum[nums[index]] = index
            else:
                return [index, targetSum[x]]
```
