## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)
Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`


## My Approach
### Time: $O(n \log n)$

The solution here is to sort by the END time, not the start time. This way, we can maximize the time for all other processes, as the process that ends sooner will be able to maximize the amount of space for other processes. 
If there exists an overlap, we donâ€™t count the interval. We try to find the maximum amount of non-overlapping intervals.
```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort by first value
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])


        lastEndTime = intervals[0][1]
        count = 1
        for currentInterval in intervals[1:]:
            if currentInterval[0] >= lastEndTime:
                lastEndTime = currentInterval[1]
                count += 1
                
        return len(intervals) - count
```
