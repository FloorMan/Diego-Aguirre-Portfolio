## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/)
The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

- For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
- For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

- `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
- `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
- `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
**Output**
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

**Explanation**
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

**Constraints:**

- `-105 <= num <= 105`
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
- At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

**Follow up:**

- If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
- If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?


## My Approach
### Time: 
```python
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.minHeap = [] # Stores the higher half of the median numbers
        self.maxHeap = [] # Stores the lower half of the median numbers
  
    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.maxHeap, -num)
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, -heapq.heappop(self.maxHeap))
        if len(self.minHeap) > len(self.maxHeap):
            heapq.heappush(self.maxHeap, -heapq.heappop(self.minHeap))
  
        #print("MaxHeap: ", self.maxHeap[0], "MinHeap: ", self.minHeap[0] if len(self.minHeap) != 0 else None)

  
    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if (len(self.maxHeap) + len(self.minHeap)) % 2 == 1:
            return -self.maxHeap[0]
        else:
            return (-self.maxHeap[0] + self.minHeap[0]) / 2.0
  
# Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MedianFinder()
# obj.addNum(num)
# param_2 = obj.findMedian()
```
We use two heaps to store our data stream. The left heap will be a max heap (min heap, but the numbers are inverted so that 2 → -2, and therefore will be placed higher than 1.) This will store the highest number to the left of the median. We do the same with the right side, where we will store the lowest number higher than the median.

When we add a number, we add it to the heap on the left. The numbers to the left and to the right are now imbalanced, so we pop off the highest number on the left and add it to the right. We have to make sure we invert it since it’s already inverted on the left, and the right side is a normal min heap. Then, we need to pop off a number on the right side, so that both sides are now in order, and the left side has +1 or +0 numbers.

To find the median, since the left side has either +1 or +0 numbers. If even, we take the average of the *negative* top of the left and the right. If odd, we just take the *negative* of the top of the left.
