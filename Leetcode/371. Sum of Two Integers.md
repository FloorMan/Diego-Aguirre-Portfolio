## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/description/)

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return _the sum of the two integers without using the operators_ `+` _and_ `-`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = 1, b = 2
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = 2, b = 3
**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

- `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

## My Approach
### Time: $O(n)$

This is a simple bit manipulation problem, it is also just literally how a hardware bitwise addition works. We get the xor of a and b, as well as the carry (found by a & b shifted once to the left). We then set b equal to our carry, and keep adding until there is no carry left. 

We also have to make sure that the carry doesnâ€™t result in an overflow. While the bounds of this question will prevent that, wwe also need to make sure we are converting correctly for an answer that is negative (2s compliment is ~x + 1).

```python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        a &= 0xffffffff
        b &= 0xffffffff

        while b:
            c = (a & b) << 1
            a = (a ^ b) & 0xffffffff
            b = c & 0xffffffff
            # print(bin(a), bin(b), bin(c))
        
        return a if a < 0x80000000 else ~(a ^ 0xffffffff)
```
